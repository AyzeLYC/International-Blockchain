# International-Blockchain

## A public blockchain created by the peoples for the peoples.

### This blockchain was created due to the need of a non opaque internations blockchain made for national housing markets, national decisions, CBDCs and crime warrants.

### I also created this blockchain due to the need of an anti power taking of the Central Bank / Government over their citizens.

### If the populations don't impose on their government and central bank to use this publicly accessible blockchain, peoples will be reduced as system slaves.


Block signature hashing algorithm : SHA 512 ( hashing algorithm created by the NSA, supposed to be able to hash an "infinite" amount of bytes )
